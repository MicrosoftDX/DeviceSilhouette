  <!-- ClusterConnectionParameters allows you to specify the PowerShell parameters to use when connecting to the Service Fabric cluster.
       Valid parameters are any that are accepted by the Connect-ServiceFabricCluster cmdlet.
       
       For a local cluster, you would typically not use any parameters.
         For example: <ClusterConnectionParameters />
  -->
  <ClusterConnectionParameters />
  <!-- Typically for local development you would have the line following this comment.
  However whilst the environment variable re-writing works for deployment (including local deployment),
  when debugging, the tools create a new Publish-NewServiceFabricApplication to set up the debugger, and that isn't customisable.
  To work around this, the Deploy script always updates the Path here to the latest transformed path
